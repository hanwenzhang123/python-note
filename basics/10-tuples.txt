lists
A python list is a way to store many pieces of data in one container, 
any kind of data, including integers, strings and even other lists
lists are mutable, we can add element and remove elements from them

tuples
tuples are immutable, they cannot be changed
elements cannot be added, removed or reordered
tuples are also zero-based


# A tuple might contain data about a person (heterogeneous type mixture)
person_a = (name, age, occupation, address)

# A list might contain a list of people (homogeneous type mixture - all tuples!)
people = [person_a, person_b, person_c]



Tuple Syntax

# A list
groceries = ['apples', 'oranges', 'lettuce', 'cheddar cheese']

# A tuple!
groceries = 'apples', 'oranges', 'lettuce', 'cheddar cheese'

# A tuple!
groceries = ('apples', 'oranges', 'lettuce', 'cheddar cheese')

To convert this list to a tuple, we can do one of two things: remove the square brackets entirely, or replace them with parentheses.


If a tuple only has one element, that element must be followed by a comma

# A tuple!
my_tuple = 1,

# The same tuple!
my_tuple = (1,)
