# Python Data Types: Python has five standard Data Types
# Numbers - var = 382
# String - firstName = 'john'
# List - A = [2, 4, 'john']
# Tuple - myGroup = ('Rhino', 'Grasshopper', 'Flamingo', 'Bongo')
# Dictionary - room_num = {'john': 425, 'tom': 212}


# Tuples are a group of values like a list and are manipulated in similar ways
# Dictionaries in Python are lists of Key:Value pairs.


# Variable Naming Rules
# Can contain both letters and digits, but must begin with either a letter or an underscore.
# Remember that case matters, you can use upper case, but by convention we do not.
# They cannot be a Python keyword

first_name = "Ada"

print('Hello, Craig")
print('Hello,', first_name)

print ('Craig is learning Python')
print (first_name, 'is learning Python')
      
      

# When you call the input function, it outputs the prompt and then it waits for an answer.
# once the answer to the prompt is given, and the user presses Enter, the result is returned.
# This input returns a string
      
      input('How are you today?')
      How are you today? Great
      'Great'
      
      current_mood = input ('How are you today?')
      How are you today? Wonderful
      current_mood
      "wonderful"
      
      
      first_name = input ('what is your first name?')

+:
How do you combine two strings? 
String 1 + String 2

The + operator doesn’t just add two numbers, it can also “add” two strings! 
The process of combining two strings is called string concatenation. 
message = string1 + string2 + string3 + string4 + string5 + string6
print(message)



+=:
a shorthand for updating variables. 
When you have a number saved in a variable and want to add to the current value of the variable, you can use the += (plus-equals) operator.
What is the value of total_cost that gets printed? # 15

total_cost = 5
total_cost += 10
print(total_cost)



Multi-line Strings:
How does one define a multi-line string in Python?
"""
Like 
this
"""




What is the output of the following code?  #42

cool_number = 12 + 30
cool_number * 5
print(cool_number)

#Multiplying the variable by 5 does not change the variable.



# f stands for format, it tells python that there will be extra tasks to do with this string before printing to the console
name = input('What is your name? ')
last_name = input('What is your last name? ')
color = input('What is your favorite color? ')

print(f'My name is {name} {last_name}')
print(f'My favorite color is {color}')
