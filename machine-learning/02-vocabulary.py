#Machine Learning Framework
Most approaches to machine learning can be described using statistical analysis and math, 
which means that some of the components for a spam filter that classifies something as spam or not spam can be reapplied to another similar problem, 
like classifying different types of zoo animals based on their physical appearance. 
For this reason, there are many high level machine learning frameworks that already have all the low level code written, 
so you can just plug your code and your data into pre-existing models.
