#Examples and Features
Example: A single element in a dataset (sample)
  A dataset is comprised on many examples. And in general, each example helps improve the confidence of your model's predictions.

Feature: One characteristic of an example
  If you formatted your data in a table, each feature might be a single column.
  

#Labels and Classifiers
Label: A category for data, or a prediction from a classification algorithm 
  like a label, spam or not spam
  
Classifier: A supervised machine learning model that makes a prediction about how a piece of data should be categorized
  like a function, Data goes in, and then the classifier predicts the correct category for that data.

There's an old saying in computing called garbage in, garbage out.
It means that if you provide the computer with bad information,
or if you give your machine learning model a data set that's inaccurate or not representative of the whole truth.
Then you're going to get a bad result.
