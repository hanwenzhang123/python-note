Machine Learning is a new approach to artificial intelligence.
With an emphasis on statistical analysis, and the ability for the computer to write
its own set of rules, rather than humans writing all of the conditional logic.

There are two major categories of Machine Learning, Supervised Learning and Unsupervised Learning.
Supervised learning is when a machine intelligence predicts a category or a quantity using models of classification and regression respectively.
Unsupervised learning is when a computer analyzes unlabeled data and attempts to recognize patterns.
  The most common unsupervised models use clustering to group similar things together.

When handling data, remember that an example is a single element in a dataset.
And a feature is one characteristic of an example.

These basic models can lead to more complex and emerging behaviors in specific domains like chatbots, image recognition, speech recognition and more.
More specialized applications like this can be served by higher level machine learning platforms including AWS and IBM Watson.
