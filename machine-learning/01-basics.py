#What is machine learning?
Machine learning encompasses many different ideas, programming languages, frameworks, and approaches to the subject, 
so the term "machine learning" is difficult to define in just a sentence or two. 
But essentially, machine learning is giving a computer the ability to write its own rules and learn about new things, on its own.


#Supervised and Unsupervised Learning
There are many different approaches or models in machine learning 
but generally, they can be broken down into two major categories called supervised learning and unsupervised learning.

Model: An algorithm or an approach to a problem
  A model in machine learning is typically probabilistic, which does not produce an exact result.
  
Probability: A means of expressing how likely it is that an event will occur, or a way of measuring how close a value might be to the actual correct value
  Value: 0 and 1
    0 being complete guess, 1 being complete certain
    
This is relevant to machine learning because if a prediction is far outside the norm, 
the model might have low confidence in the answer, because it's highly probable that it's not correct.
If the prediction matches up almost perfectly with an existing example in a data set, then the confidence will be very high.


Two Major Categories of Machine Learning:  
1. Supervised learning: A case where a machine intelligence is tasked with predicting a category or a quantity

Supervised learning is when a machine intelligence is tasked with predicting a category or a quantity.

Classification: A supervised machine learning model that makes a prediction about how a piece of data should be categorized
  e.g. email, spam email, promotional email
Regression: A supervised machine learning model that attempts to predict a quantity or a number
  e.g. predict the appropriate price by looking for the average price of a dish around the area of your newly open restaurant

2. Unsupervised learning: A case where a computer analyzes unlabeled data and has no previous examples, and tries to identify patterns in the data
Clustering: An unsupervised machine learning model that attempts to group similar examples together
  e.g. suggested friends, suggested videos, advertisement sites
  
  
#Machine Learning Framework
Most approaches to machine learning can be described using statistical analysis and math, 
which means that some of the components for a spam filter that classifies something as spam or not spam can be reapplied to another similar problem, 
like classifying different types of zoo animals based on their physical appearance. 
For this reason, there are many high level machine learning frameworks that already have all the low level code written, 
so you can just plug your code and your data into pre-existing models.
